# Risks

There are two primary areas of risk in the Porter protocol: smart contract vulnerabilities and bond defaults.

## Smart Contract Risk

The amount of value held by smart contracts increases their risk profile. The threat of contract vulnerabilities is taken extremely seriously by the Porter team. The protocol code will be thoroughly inspected both internally and externally by security organizations.

## Default Risk

Unavoidably, lending carries a risk of default. To limit this risk, lenders have traditionally put borrowers through an underwriting process. To avoid defaults, lending protocols such as Aave and Compound, which are currently accessible in DeFi, require overcollateralization and enforce liquidation.&#x20;

Porter uses underwriting and overcollateralization to mitigate default risk, however borrowers are not subject to liquidations. A light underwriting process is performed through verification but, ultimately, investors are responsible for applying their own underwriting techniques to determine the credit worthiness of bond issuers. At launch, DAOs will be required to overcollateralize their borrowing with their native project token.
