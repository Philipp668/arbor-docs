# Products

Borrowing on Porter starts with the issuance of a product. At launch, Porter will offer two products: [Simple](simple.md) and [Convert](convert.md).

Below is an example user flow to illustrate how a DAO (exampleDAO) would borrow using Porter.

1. exampleDAO issues 1,000,000 [Simple](simple.md) bonds, putting up their project token as collateral and choosing a maturity date.
2. exampleDAO sells 1,000,000 [Simple](simple.md) bonds for 900,000 USDC via an auction or OTC.
3. At the maturity date, exampleDAO repays 1,000,000 USDC and claims their collateral.
