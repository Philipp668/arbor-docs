# Varieties of bonds

The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties. They can be separated by the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes.

### Zero-coupon bonds <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-51" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-51"></a>

[Zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp) do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. Porter bonds are zero-coupon bonds.

### Convertible bonds <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-54" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-54"></a>

[Convertible bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp) are debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into project tokens. For example, imagine a DAO that needs to borrow 1M USDC to fund a new project. They could borrow by issuing bonds with a 12% coupon that matures in 10 years. However, if they know that there are some investors willing to buy bonds with an 8% coupon that allows them to convert the bond into project tokens, they might prefer to issue those.

The convertible bond may be the best solution for the DAO because they will have lower interest payments while the project is in its early stages. If the investors convert their bonds the DAO does not have to pay any more interest or the principal of the bond.

The investors who purchase a convertible bond may think this is a great solution because they can profit from the upside in the project token if the project is successful. They are taking more risk by accepting a lower coupon payment, but the potential reward if the bonds are converted could make that trade-off acceptable.

### Callable bonds <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-61" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-61"></a>

[Callable bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp) also have an embedded option but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond is one that can be “called” back by the DAO before it matures. Assume that a DAO has borrowed 1M USDC by issuing bonds with a 10% coupon that mature in 10 years. If interest rates decline (or the DAO's credit rating improves) in year 5 when the DAO could borrow for 8%, they will call or buy the bonds back from the bondholders for the principal amount and reissue new bonds at a lower coupon rate.

A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. Remember, when interest rates are falling, bond prices rise. Because of this, callable bonds are not as valuable as bonds that aren’t callable with the same maturity, credit rating, and coupon rate.

### Puttable bond <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-66" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-66"></a>

A [puttable bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putbond.asp) allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the DAO before it has matured. This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value, or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value.

The bond issuer may include a put option in the bond that benefits the bondholders in return for a lower coupon rate or just to induce the bond sellers to make the initial loan. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.

The possible combinations of embedded puts, calls, and convertibility rights in a bond are endless and each one is unique. There isn’t a strict standard for each of these rights and some bonds will contain more than one kind of “option” which can make comparisons difficult. Generally, individual investors rely on bond professionals to select individual bonds or bond funds that meet their investing goals.
