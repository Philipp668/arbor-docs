# Overview

Convertible bonds are a flexible financing option for companies. A convertible bond offers investors a type of hybrid security, which has features of a bond such as interest payments while also providing the opportunity of owning the project token. A bond's [conversion ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionratio.asp) determines how many project tokens you can get from converting one bond.

As an example, let's say Uniswap issued a convertible bond with a 1 USDC face value that pays 6% interest. The bond has a maturity of 2 years and a convertible ratio of 0.03 UNI tokens for every convertible bond.

If the bond is held until maturity, the investor will be paid 1 USDC in principal. However, UNI suddenly spikes and is trading at 50 USDC per token. As a result, the 0.03 UNI tokens are worth 1.50 USDC (0.03 UNI x 50 USDC token price), which exceeds the value of the bond. The investor can convert the bond into UNI and receive 0.03 UNI, which could be sold in the market for 1.50 USDC in total.
