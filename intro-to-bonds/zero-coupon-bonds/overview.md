# Overview

Bonds that do not have coupons are referred to as zero-coupon bonds. These bonds are issued at a discount and repay the par value, at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually, at a stated yield.

The interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is an [imputed interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imputedinterest.asp), meaning that it is an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. For example, a bond with a face amount of 1 USDC, that matures in 2 years, with a 10% yield, may be purchased for roughly 0.83 USDC. At the end of the 2 years, the investor will receive 1 USDC. The difference between 1 USDC and 0.83 USDC (or 0.17 USDC) represents the [interest that compounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp) automatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as "phantom interest."

Because they offer the entire payment at maturity, zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price, much more so than [coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/couponbond.asp).
