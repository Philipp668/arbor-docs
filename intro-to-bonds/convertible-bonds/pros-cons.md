# Pros/Cons

Pros

* Investors receive fixed-rate interest payments with the option to convert to stock and benefit from stock price appreciation.
* Investors get some default risk security since bondholders are paid before common stockholders.
* Companies benefit by raising capital without immediately diluting their shares.
* Companies may pay lower interest rates on their debt compared to using traditional bonds.

Cons

* Due to the option to convert the bond into common stock, they offer a lower coupon rate.
* Issuing companies with little or no earnings—like startups—create an additional risk for convertible bond investors.
* Share dilution happens if the bonds convert to stock shares, which may depress the share's price and EPS dynamics.
