# Welcome

### Overview

Porter allows DAOs and other on-chain entities to obtain financing by selling long-term debt in the form of tokenized bonds. It facilitates debt pricing, issuance, and repayment.

Porter offers borrowers transparent and efficient debt issuance completed entirely on-chain. For lenders, Porter offers a long term, fixed interest yield source with equity upside through lending to creditworthy DAOs. The underwriters who support the debt offerings perform due diligence and set terms with bond issuers.

### Mission

Our mission is to enable DAOs to grow and thrive by giving them access to credit.

If you believe DAOs should have access to credit, join the discussion in the [Porter community discord](https://discord.gg/mx8tsEaNut). We look forward to meeting you!
