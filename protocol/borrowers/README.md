# Borrowers

Porter provides on-chain funding that is transparent and efficient. Borrowers can use their project tokens as collateral to borrow without having to worry about liquidations or interest rate risk.

Borrowers are on-chain entities looking to borrow capital at a fixed interest rate over a pre-determined term length of time.
