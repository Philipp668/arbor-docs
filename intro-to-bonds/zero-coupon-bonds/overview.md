# Overview

Some bonds are issued as zero-coupon instruments from the start, while other bonds transform into zero-coupon instruments after a financial institution strips them of their coupons, and repackages them as zero-coupon bonds. Because they offer the entire payment at maturity, zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price, much more so than [coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/couponbond.asp).

A bond is a portal through which a corporate or governmental body raises capital. When bonds are issued, investors purchase those bonds, effectively acting as lenders to the issuing entity. The investors earn a return in the form of [coupon payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp), which are made semiannually or annually, throughout the life of the bond.

When the [bond matures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), the bondholder is repaid an amount equal to the [face value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) of the bond. The par or face value of a corporate bond is typically stated as $1,000. If a corporate bond is issued at a discount, this means investors can purchase the bond below its par value. For example, an investor who purchases a bond for $920 at a discount will receive $1,000. The $80 return, plus coupon payments received on the bond, is the investor's earnings or return for holding the bond.

But not all bonds have coupon payments. Those that do not are referred to as zero-coupon bonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount and repay the par value, at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually, at a stated yield.

The interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is an [imputed interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imputedinterest.asp), meaning that it is an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. For example, a bond with a face amount of $20,000, that matures in 20 years, with a 5.5% yield, may be purchased for roughly $6,855. At the end of the 20 years, the investor will receive $20,000. The difference between $20,000 and $6,855 (or $13,145) represents the [interest that compounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp) automatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as "phantom interest."

The imputed interest on the bond is subject to [income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp), according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Therefore, although no coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity, investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year. Purchasing a municipal zero-coupon bond, buying zero-coupon bonds in a tax-exempt account, or purchasing a corporate zero-coupon bond that has tax-exempt status are a few ways to avoid paying income taxes on these securities.
