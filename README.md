# Welcome

### Overview

Porter allows [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) to borrow stablecoins using their project tokens as collateral with fixed rates, no liquidation risk, and guaranteed liquidity.

For [lenders](protocol/lenders/), Porter offers a long term, fixed interest yield source with token upside through lending to creditworthy DAOs.

### Mission

Our mission is to enable DAOs to grow and thrive by giving them access to credit.

If you believe DAOs should have access to credit, join the discussion in the [Porter community discord](https://discord.gg/mx8tsEaNut). We look forward to meeting you!
