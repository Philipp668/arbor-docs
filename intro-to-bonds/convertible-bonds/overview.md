# Overview

Convertible bonds are a flexible financing option for companies. A convertible bond offers investors a type of hybrid security, which has features of a bond such as interest payments while also providing the opportunity of owning the stock. This bond's [conversion ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionratio.asp) determines how many shares of stock you can get from converting one bond. For example, a 5:1 ratio means that one bond would convert to five shares of common stock.

The [conversion price ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionprice.asp)is the price per share at which a convertible security, such as corporate bonds or preferred shares, can be converted into [common stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp). The conversion price is set when the conversion ratio is decided for a [convertible security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertible-security.asp).
