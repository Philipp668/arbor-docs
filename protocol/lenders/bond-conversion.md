# Bond conversion

If a lender has purchased a convertible bond, they are able to redeem their bond tokens for the conversion tokens at a predetermined conversion rate. This conversion can happen at any time after the issuance up until the maturity date. After the maturity date, conversion will no longer be allowed and bondholders will accept repayment in the borrowed asset.
