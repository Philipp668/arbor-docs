# FAQ

### How is Porter different than OlympusDAO?

Although OlympusDAO uses the term "bond", they are not selling bonds. A bond is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) and to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. OlympusDAO's bonding mechanism can be simplified to selling tokens at a discount with a lockup period. From the OlympusDAO's documentation: _\[Bonding] allows Olympus to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets such as LUSD by selling OHM at a discount in exchange for these assets._
