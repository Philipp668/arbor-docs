# FAQ

### Do you have a token?

We have not launched a [token](protocol/prtr-token.md). However, when we do, early users and partners will be compensated.

### How is Porter different than OlympusDAO?

Although OlympusDAO uses the term "bond", they are not selling bonds. A bond is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) and to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. OlympusDAO's bonding mechanism does not require principal to be repaid and therefore can be simplified to selling tokens at a discount with a lockup period. From the OlympusDAO's documentation: _\[Bonding] allows Olympus to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets such as LUSD by selling OHM at a discount in exchange for these assets._

### How is Porter Convert different than UMA Range Tokens?

Similar to the OlympusDAO bonds, UMA Range Tokens do not require principal to be repaid. Therefore, when a DAO sells a Range Token, they are not borrowing, they are selling their project tokens with more or fewer tokens being sold depending on the price of their project token at the settlement date.
