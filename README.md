# Porter Document Portal

Porter allows DAOs and other on-chain entities to obtain financing by selling long-term debt in the form of tokenized bonds. It facilitates debt pricing, issuance, and repayment.

This Portal links to the key resources on Porter to understand the fundamentals of the Protocol. Please join the discussion on [Porter community Discord server](http://discord.gg/9hJKzXPjHm); our team and members of the community look forward to helping you learn about Porter.
