# Defaults

If a borrower does not repay principal and interest by the maturity date, the bond is in default and the borrower's collateral and any payments made become claimable by the bondholders.

Because lenders are selling puts on the collateral tokens, they are exposed to the collateral token's downside past the option strike price. For this, they are compensated with option premium which augments their returns.
