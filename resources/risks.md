# Risks

There are two primary areas of risk in the Porter protocol: smart contract vulnerabilities and bond defaults.

## Smart Contract Risk

The amount of value held by smart contracts increases their risk profile. The threat of contract vulnerabilities is taken extremely seriously by the Porter team. The protocol code will be thoroughly inspected both internally and externally by security organizations.

## Default Risk

By definition, undercollateralized lending carries a risk of default. To limit this risk, lenders have traditionally put borrowers through an underwriting process. To avoid defaults, lending protocols such as Aave and Compound, which are currently accessible in DeFi, require overcollateralization.&#x20;

By allowing Sherpas and investors to apply their own underwriting techniques to determine the credit worthiness of bond issuers, the Porter protocol allows for more capital efficient lending. The Porter governance process scrutinizes Sherpas and their strategy for establishing credit worthiness.
