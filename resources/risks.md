# Risks

### Smart Contract Risk

The amount of value held by smart contracts increases their risk profile. The threat of contract vulnerabilities is taken extremely seriously by the Porter team. The protocol code will be thoroughly inspected both internally and externally by security organizations.

### Default Risk

Because lenders are selling puts on the collateral tokens, they are exposed to the collateral token's downside past the option strike price. For this, they are compensated with option premium which augments their returns. That being said, options are complicated financial instruments and should not be used unless fully understood. Do your own research and take responsibility for your financial future.
