# Defaults

If a borrower does not repay principal and interest by the maturity date, the bond is in default. Borrowers then have a five day grace period to remedy the default by making the required payment. If the principal and interest is not paid within the grace period, their collateral is transferred the bondholders.

If the value of the collateral is less than the value owed, the debt owed is determined and the parties undergo mediation. If the issuer and bondholders cannot agree on an outcome via mediation, the case is then moved to arbitration where a mutually agreed upon third party decides the required remediation actions.

Verified borrowers enter a Master Loan Agreement during onboarding which enables legal enforcement.
