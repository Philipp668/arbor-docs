# Pricing

The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated as:

> Price = M รท (1 + r)^n

where:

* M = Maturity value or face value of the bond
* r = required rate of interest
* n = number of years until maturity

If an investor wishes to make a 6% return on a bond, with $25,000 par value, that is due to mature in three years, they will be willing to pay the following:

> $25,000 / (1 + 0.06)3 = $20,991.

If the debtor accepts this offer, the bond will be sold to the investor at $20,991 / $25,000 = 84% of the face value. Upon maturity, the investor gains $25,000 - $20,991 = $4,009, which translates to 6% interest per year. The greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa.
