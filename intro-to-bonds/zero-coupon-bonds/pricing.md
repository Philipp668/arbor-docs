# Pricing

The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated as:

> Price = M รท (1 + r)^n

where:

* M = Maturity value or face value of the bond
* r = required rate of interest
* n = number of years until maturity

If an investor wishes to make a 10% return on a bond, with 1 USDC par value, that is due to mature in two years, they will be willing to pay the following:

> 1 USDC / (1 + 0.1)^2 = 0.83 USDC

If the debtor accepts this offer, the bond will be sold to the investor at 0.83 USDC / 1 USDC = 83% of the face value. Upon maturity, the investor gains 1 USDC - 0.83 USDC = 0.17 USDC, which translates to 10% interest per year. The greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa.
