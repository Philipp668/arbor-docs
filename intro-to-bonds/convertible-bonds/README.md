# Convertible Bonds

A convertible bond yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can be done at certain times during the bond's life and is usually at the discretion of the [bondholder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp).

The price of a convertible bond is especially sensitive to changes in interest rates, the price of the underlying stock, and the issuer's [credit rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp).
