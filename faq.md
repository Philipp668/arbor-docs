# FAQ

### What types of bonds can be issued on Porter?

At launch, Porter will support [zero coupon bonds](intro-to-bonds/zero-coupon-bonds/) with the option of making them [convertible](intro-to-bonds/convertible-bonds/). These instruments best address the needs of market participants at the current state. Porter will allow coupon bonds and other types of debt instruments to be issued in the future.

### How is Porter different than OlympusDAO?

Although OlympusDAO uses the term "bond", they are not selling bonds. A bond is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) and to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. OlympusDAO's bonding mechanism can be simplified to selling tokens at a discount with a lockup period. From the OlympusDAO's documentation: _\[Bonding] allows Olympus to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets such as LUSD by selling OHM at a discount in exchange for these assets._

### Do you have a token?

We have not launched a [token](protocol/prtr-token.md). However, when we do, early users and partners will be compensated.
