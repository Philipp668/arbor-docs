# How to purchase bonds

Bonds can be purchased through participation in bond auctions. Lenders submit bids containing a volume and interest rate. At auction end, the interest rate for the bond is set and depends on the supply and demand. If the lender's bid is at or below the set interest rate, their order will be filled.
