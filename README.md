# Welcome

### Overview

Porter allows [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) and other on-chain entities to borrow stablecoins using their tokens as collateral with fixed rates and no liquidations.

For lenders, Porter offers high, fixed yields and token price upside using lending and option strategies.

### Mission

Our mission is to enable DAOs to grow and thrive by giving them access to credit.

If you believe DAOs should have access to credit, join the discussion in the [Porter community discord](https://discord.gg/mx8tsEaNut). We look forward to meeting you!
