# Tax considerations

The imputed interest on zero-coupon bonds is subject to income tax, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Therefore, although no coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity, investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year. Buying zero-coupon bonds using a tax-exempt entity is one of the ways to avoid paying income taxes.
