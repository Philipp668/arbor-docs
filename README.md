# Welcome

### Overview

Arbor allows [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) and other on-chain entities to borrow stablecoins using their tokens as collateral with fixed rates and no liquidations.

For lenders, Arbor offers sustainable, fixed yields and token price upside through lending and options.

### Mission

Our mission is to enable DAOs to grow and thrive by giving them access to credit.

If you believe DAOs should have access to credit, join the discussion in the [Arbor community discord](https://discord.gg/T72Rdzu3). We look forward to meeting you!
